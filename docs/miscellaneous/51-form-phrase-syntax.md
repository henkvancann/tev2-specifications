# Form Phrases and their Syntax

This document is deprecated. It remains here for the purpose of reusing texts in guides that need to be authored.

This document specifies the syntax of [form phrases](@).

[Form phrases](@) are [used to automatically convert](trrt#id@) the `show text` parts of [term refs](@) into `[termid](@)`s, for the purpose of accommodating, e.g., plural forms (for nouns) or conjugate forms (for verbs). This facilitates the work for [authors](@), as this no longer requires them to explicitly mention the `term` part in a [term ref](@) when the `showtext` they use matches one of the [form phrases](@).

## Simple Form Phrases

A single [form phrase](@) is a sequence of characters that matches [regex](@) `[a-z0-9_-]+`, where the first and last characters are not `-`. The contents of the `formPhrases` field (in the [header](@) of a [curated text](@)) is a comma-separated list of such [form phrases](@). Note that if a [form phrase](@) contains a special character, it must be surrounded with single or double quotes.

The `formPhrases`-field is used by the [trrt](@) in its attempts to [convert the `showtext`](trrt#showtext@) part of a [term ref](@) into a string that can serve as the `term` of that [term ref](@).

The [trrt](@) does so by looping over the [terms](@) of the designated [terminology](@), and checking whether or not such a [term](@) is a match, as follows:

- First, the [trrt](@) simplifies the `showtext`, by converting uppercase characters to lowercase, and replacing (sequences of) special characters and spaces with a single `-` character. Thus a `showtext` with value `Form - Phrase` would be converted into `form-phrase`.
- Then, the [trrt](@) checks whether the result matches the contents of the `term`-field, and is done when that's the case. 
- If there is no match, the [trrt](@) checks whether the result matches any of the [form phrases](@) in the `formPhrases` field. If that is the case, there is a match, and the [term ref](@) of which the `showtext` is a part will be referring to the matching [term](@).

Thus, if the `showtext` of a [term ref](@) is `actor's`, and the `formPhrases` field of some [curated text](@) contains `actors, actor's, actor(s)`, there would be a match, and the [term ref](@) would refer to that [term](@)). 

Similarly, if the `showtext` is `Term Refs`, and some (other) [curated text](@) has a `term` field containing `termref` and its `formPhrases` field contains `termrefs, term-ref, term-refs`, then there would be a match. Note that other `showtexts`, such as `TermRef`, `termref`, `term-ref`, `term%refs`, etc., would also result in a match.

   <summary>Detailed example</summary>

Consider a text with a [term ref](@), e.g., 

~~~ markdown
...
This is a text that is about [actors](actor@), and the [actor's](actor@) capabilities.
This text also says what the [actor(s)](actor@) might be doing.
...
~~~

As you can see, the `showtexts` are plurals or conjugate forms of the term `actor`.
It would help [authors](@) if they could write this text as follows:

~~~ markdown
...
This is a text that is about [actors](@), and the [actor's](@) capabilities.
This text also says what the [actor(s)](@) might be doing.
...
~~~

which would require the [trrt](@) to automatically convert such plurals or conjugate forms into the corresponding base term. That's where [form phrases](@) come in.

This can be done by specifying such plurals, conjugate forms, or any other texts as a [form phrase](@) and adding it to the `formPhrases` field (in the [header](@)) of the [curated text](@) that documents the base term (`actor` in our example), as follows:

~~~ yaml
formPhrases: [ "actor", "actors", "actor's", "actor(s)" ]
~~~

## Form phrase macros {#form-phrase-macros}

When you have worked some time with [form phrases](@), you will have noticed some patterns. For example, there many nouns (such as `actor`, `term`, or `form phrase`) have a plural form that can be constructing by adding an `s`, and it is convenient to specify such a plural form as a [form phrase](@). These nouns also have other often recurring forms, that are constructed by adding, e.g., `'s`, or `(s)`.

A [form phrase](@) macro is a syntax that allows you to specify such a pattern as a single [form phrase](@). For example, the constructions mentioned in the previous paragraph can be specified by adding `{ss}` to the noun, as in `actor{ss}`, `term{ss}`, and `form-phrase{ss}`. The text `{ss}` is a form phrase macro; it is a shorthand syntax that, when used in a [form phrase](@), specifies a list of [form phrases](@) that are derived from its non-macro part.

Details can be found in the [specifications of form phrases](form-phrase-macros#predefineds@)

The following table specifies the [form phrase](@) macros that have currently being defined. The table shows 
1. the macro text,
2. the [regex](@) that is used for checking whether a (simplified) `showtext` matches the [form phrase](@),
3. an example that could appear as a [form phrase](@) in a `formPhrases`-field of a [curated text](@),
4. the set of (simplified) `showtext`s that would match that [form phrase](@):

| macro    | character string map      | example         | is exapanded into |
| -------- | :-----------------------: | :-------------: | :---------------- |
| `{ss}`   | "", "s", "'s", "(s)"      | `actor{ss}`     | "actor", "actors", "actor's", and "actor(s)" |
| `{ess}`  | "", "es", "'s", "(es)"    | `regex{es}`     | "regex", "regexes", "regex's", "regex(es)" |
| `{yies}` | "y", "y's", "ies"         | `part{yies}`    | "party", "party's", and "parties" |
| `{ying}` | "y", "ying", "ies", "ied" | `identif{ying}` | "identify", "identifying", "identifies", and "identified" |
| `{es}`   | "e", "es", "ed", "ing"    | `manag{es}`     | "manage", "manages", "managed", "managing" |
| `{able}` | "able", "ability"         | `cap{able}`     | "capable", "capability" |

:::tip Use macro's with care.
The above macro's should be used with care. Here are some tips:

1. Use `{ss}` macro only for **nouns** whose plural is constructed by adding an `s`.
2. Use `{yies}` only for **nouns** that end with a `y`.
3. Use `{yies}` only for **verbs** that end with a `y`.
4. Use `{es}` only for **regular verbs** that conjugate as specified.

   <summary>Example of a form phrase macro and its use</summary>

Suppose we have a [curated text](@) for the term `actor`, and in its [front matter](@), we specify:

~~~ yaml
formPhrases: [ "identif{yies}" ]
~~~

The part `{yies}` is a (predefined) macro, that is associated with the [regex](@) `(y|y's|ies)`.

When the [trrt](@) converts a [term ref](@), one of the things it needs to do is to [convert a so-called `show-text` into a `term`](trrt#showtext@) that exists in some [curated text](@). If the `show-text` does not match the `term` of any of the [curated texts](@), the [trrt](@) will try to match it against every form phrase in every [curated text](@), including the [form phrase](@) `actor{ss}`.

You can think of how this work as follows[^3]. When the [trrt](@) encounters a `showtext`, it will loop over [curated texts](@) (or [MRG entries](@)) to find a match. If it can't find one (in case `showtext` is not the value of the `term` field), it will the take the list of [form phrases](@) specified in the `formPhrases` field, and replace every of its [form phrase](@) that contains a macro, with all possible [form phrases] that do not contain a macro. For example, if the contents of the `formPhrases` field would be `identifier{ss}, identif(ying)`, the replacement result would be the list `identifier`, `identifiers`, `identifier's`, `identifier(s)`, `identify`, `identifier`, `identifying`, `identifies` and `identified`. So there would be a match if the `showtext` would equal any of these [term refs](@).

[^3]: Actual implementations are expected to do this in a more efficient way.
