# ERROR - The reference cannot be resolved

When you are here, you have clicked on a [term](@) that hasn't been (properly) defined.

## Explanation

When a [term](@) `someterm` isn't defined, the [TermRef](@) `[someterm](@)` will product a link to a term with `id=@`. So when you click that [TermRef](@), your browser will navigate to this page, because it is a the location of where the [curated text](@) for `@` would be.
