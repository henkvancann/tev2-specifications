# Using Wikis

One way in which [curators](@) may decide that people can contribute, is by providing a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) that the people are encouraged to edit, discuss, and evolve to a level of maturity that warrants the text to be [ingested](@) into the [scope's](@) [corpus](@). The [curators](@) SHOULD specify the procedures, the code of conduct, etc. that support and enable the maturing of these texts, and how it is decided that such texts can become part of the [scope's](@) [corpus](@). That's outside the scope of this document.

## Users contributions

From the [TEv2](@) perspective, people may contribute by [creating or editing wiki-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages) for a specific [semantic unit](@). The [curators](@) would typically already have various wiki-pages, each of which serves as a template for e.g. the [definition](@) of a [concept](@) or [term](@), a [use-case](@), a [mental model](@), or any other kind of [semantic unit](@) that is relevant within the [scope](@).

A [user](@) can take the template, and follow the associated instructions (e.g. provide content for the various sections). That's basically it.

A [user](@) can use [TermRefs](@) to mark the terms that it wants to be linked to a specific meaning ([semantic unit](@)).

## Curators tasks

[Curators](@) that have decided to use a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) as a means for people to contribute to the development of it's [scope's](@) [corpus](@), should do the following:

1. If you do not already have one, [create a git account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

2. [Create a (git) repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo), either a brand new one, or [from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
